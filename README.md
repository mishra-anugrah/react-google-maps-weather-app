## Weather App

- Developed by **Anugrah Mishra**
- Frontend library : `React.js`
- APIs used : `OpenWeather API` for weather and Geolocation
- Libraries used : `@google-react-map/api` for rendering Google Maps

**NOTE**: PLEASE USE `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` as the some libraries being used in this project are on React 16. This point will be fixed in the future.
